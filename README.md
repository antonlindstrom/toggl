# toggle - Simple toggl command line

This is a simple command line to start/stop timers on [toggl](toggl.com/app/timer). I scratched an itch, hope you'll find it useful.

## Usage

    toggl -h
    usage: toggl start <project>|stop|status|projects
      -version
            show version and exit

You'll need a `~/.togglrc` with your API key and project id. See an example
[here](togglrc-example).
